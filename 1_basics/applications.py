and NumPy that are used in general purpose computing. And, there are specific libraries like: EarthPy for earth science,
AstroPy for Astronomy and so on. Also, the language is heavily used in machine learning, data mining and deep learning.



Creating software Prototypes

Python is slow compared to compiled languages like C++ and Java. It might not be a good choice if resources are
limited and efficiency is a must. However, Python is a great language for creating prototypes. For example:
You can use Pygame (library for creating games) to create your game's prototype first. If you like the prototype,
you can use language like C++ to create the actual game.
