Install Python Separately
If you don't want to use Thonny, here's how you can install and run Python on your computer.

Download the latest version of Python.
Run the installer file and follow the steps to install Python
During the install process, check Add Python to environment variables. This will add Python to environment variables and you are able to run Python from any part of the computer.
Also, you can choose the path where Python is installed.
Once you finish the installation process, you can run Python.

1. Run Python in Immediate mode
Once Python is installed, typing python in the command line will invoke the interpreter in immediate mode. We can directly type in Python code and press enter to get the output.
Try typing in 1 + 1 and press enter. We get 2 as the output. This prompt can be used as a calculator. To exit this mode type quit() and press enter.


2. Run Python in the Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
We can use any text editing software to write a Python script file.

We just need to save it with the .py extension. But using an IDE can make our life a lot easier. IDE is a piece of software that provides useful features like code hinting, syntax highlighting and checking, file explorers etc. to the programmer for application development.

By the way, when you install Python, an IDE named IDLE is also installed. You can use it to run Python on your computer. It's a decent IDE for beginners.

When you open IDLE, an interactive Python Shell is opened.

Now you can create a new file and save it with .py extension. For example, hello.py

Write Python code in the file, save it. To run the file go to Run > Run Module or simply click F5.
