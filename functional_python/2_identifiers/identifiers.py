IDENTIFIERS

A Python identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, class, module or other object.
An identifier starts with a letter A to Z or a to z or an underscore (_) followed by zero or more
letters, underscores and digits (0 to 9).

Python does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $, and % within 2_identifiers.
Python is a case sensitive programming language.
Thus, Manpower and manpower are two different 2_identifiers in Python.



Here are naming conventions for Python 2_identifiers âˆ’


1. Class names start with an uppercase letter. All other 2_identifiers start with a lowercase letter.

2 . Starting an identifier with a single leading underscore indicates that the identifier is private.

3. Starting an identifier with two leading underscores indicates a strongly private identifier.

4. If the identifier also ends with two trailing underscores, the identifier is a language-defined special name.
