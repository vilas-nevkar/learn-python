Simple Elegant Syntax

Programming in Python is fun. It's easier to understand and write Python code. Why? The syntax feels natural.
Take this source code for an example: Even if you have never programmed before, you can easily guess that this program
adds two numbers and prints it.
"""

a = 2
b = 3
sum = a + b
print(sum)

"""
Not overly strict

You don't need to define the type of a variable in Python. Also, it's not necessary to add semicolon at the end of the
statement. Python enforces you to follow good practices (like proper indentation). These small things can make learning
much easier for beginners.


Expressiveness of the language

Python allows you to write programs having greater functionality with fewer lines of code. Here's a link to the source
code of Tic-tac-toe game with a graphical interface and a smart computer opponent in less than 500 lines of code.
This is just an example. You will be amazed how much you can do with Python once you learn the basics.


Great Community and Support

Python has a large supporting community. There are numerous active forums online which can be handy if you are stuck. Some of them are:
    Learn Python subreddit
    Google Forum for Python
    Python Questions - Stack Overflow
