"""
Python is a fairly old language created by Guido Van Rossum.
The design began in the late 1980s and was first released in February 1991.

Why Python was created?

In late 1980s, Guido Van Rossum was working on the Amoeba distributed operating system group.
He wanted to use an interpreted language like ABC (ABC has simple easy-to-understand syntax) that could access the
Amoeba system calls. So, he decided to create a language that was extensible.
This led to design of a new language which was later named Python.

Why the name Python?

No. It wasn't named after a dangerous snake. Rossum was fan of a comedy series from late seventies.
The name "Python" was adopted from the same series "Monty Python's Flying Circus".
